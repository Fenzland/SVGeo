SVGeo.js
================================

[SVGeo](https://svgeo.fenzland.com.)

This is a library for drawing interactive geometry graphs with ECMAScript work on browsers. 
SVGeo is powered by [SVG](https://www.w3.org./Graphics/SVG/) and [OvO](https://github.com./Fenzland/ovo.js). 
So your browsers must support SVG and ES6 modules. 


Currently, we support Euclidean 2D space and Minkowski 2D space. 
You can draw points, lines and circles in this two type of spaces. 
Here are what you can do: Drawing a point with (x,y) or (t,x) coordinate; 
Setting it as free point so that your visitors can drag it with their mouses; 
Making a animation with setting coordinate of points; 
Drawing a line with two points. 
Drawing a circle with a center point and a radius; 
Crossing two lines, two circles, or a line and a circle, and draw the intersection points; 
Through a point and drawing a perpendicular line or parallel line of a particular line; 
Coloring and styling elements .
